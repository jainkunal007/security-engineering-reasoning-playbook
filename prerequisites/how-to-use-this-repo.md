# How to Use This Repository

This repository is designed to help you **think like a security engineer**, not memorize security facts.

Security interviews and real-world security work rarely ask:
- “Do you know this vulnerability?”
- “Can you list this framework?”

Instead, they ask:
- “What could go wrong here?”
- “What would you look at first?”
- “What tradeoffs would you make?”

This repository trains that way of thinking.

## Who This Repository Is For

This repository is for you if:
- You are starting your career in cybersecurity
- You are a software engineer moving into security
- You struggle with open-ended security interview questions
- You want to understand *why* security controls exist, not just *what* they are

This repository may **not** be ideal if:
- You want tool-specific tutorials
- You want certification-style memorization
- You want exploit development or red-team deep dives

## How Security Learning Is Different

In security:
- The system is often incomplete
- The threat is uncertain
- There is rarely a single correct answer

Good security engineers:
- Scope problems before solving them
- Identify trust boundaries
- Think in terms of failure modes and abuse
- Communicate tradeoffs clearly

This repository focuses on building those skills.

## The Learning Layers

This repository is structured in **layers**. You do not need to know everything before moving forward.

### 1️⃣ Security Foundations (Think First)
You will start with foundational ideas that appear everywhere:
- CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- Trust boundaries
- Attacker mindset
- Threat modeling
- Least privilege
- Failure vs attack

These are the **mental models** you will reuse throughout the repository.

### 2️⃣ Technical Prerequisites (Just Enough)
Next, you will learn the minimum technical background needed to understand modern systems:
- Networking
- Web basics
- Cryptography
- Operating systems
- Cloud fundamentals

These are **security-focused explanations**, not full courses.

📁 `prerequisites/`

---

### 3️⃣ System Walkthroughs (Apply Security Thinking)
You will then walk through real systems:
- Web requests
- Authentication flows
- TLS and certificates
- APIs and services
- Data protection

Each walkthrough is written from a **security engineering perspective**.

---

## How to Read the Content

- Do **not** memorize
- Do **not** rush
- Ask yourself:
  - What are the assets?
  - Where are the trust boundaries?
  - What assumptions does this system make?
  - What happens when those assumptions fail?

If something feels unclear, pause and skim the linked prerequisite — then return.

---

## When to Move Forward

You are ready to move forward when:
- You can explain a system at a high level
- You can identify at least one security risk
- You can explain *why* a mitigation exists

You do **not** need perfect understanding.

Security is learned by iteration.

---

## How This Helps in Interviews

Interviewers care less about:
- Exact terminology
- Perfect answers

They care more about:
- How you structure problems
- How you handle uncertainty
- How you reason out loud

This repository helps you practice that skill.

---

## Final Note

Security is not about knowing everything.
It is about knowing **where to look, what to question, and how to reason**.

Take your time.
Return often.
Re-read with new context.

That’s how real security understanding is built.
